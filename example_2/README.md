# Solution + Thought Process

1. In the photo that we are given for this challenge, we are actually given a decent amount of information to get us started. We see that "Flinders Street" is showcased 3 times, so let's take a look into. Let's even include a railway in our search...

2. Upon googling the phrase "Flinders Street railway station", we are actually shown a Wikipedia page with the exact title. This has to be the location in the picture right? 

3. It may not be evident at first that this is the correct place, but we can quickly find pictures online that point to the IBM building in the photo being directly behind the train station as seen. Now that we have the correct location in the photo, we are able to conclude **Part A** of the problem...

4. At first glance, the example photo given shows that the biggest building appears to be the IBM Tower. Due to the perspective, this is a little misleading. I decided to crack open Google Earth to get a good scale of this area. Let's grab the coordinates of the railway station from the Wiki page and travel to Austrailia...
